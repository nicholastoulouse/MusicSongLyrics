# Project Description: Music, Song, and Lyrics
For users who aim to sing more in their domestic life, the app aims to pair artist and song to retrieve music lyrics and a video to encourage users with inspiration to sing along. The app enables users to store favorites in storage in order to create playlists.
To view the web app in action go to: https://nicholastoulouse.github.io/MusicSongLyrics/lyrics.html Then type username: huwu to see fully populated playlists OR create your own.
